  A&B Drafting Standards

  1. All changes made to drawings have to be clouded and noted with Version triangle. Exception to this rule
  is
  Version A and 0.
  Version Triangle has to touch Version cloud in all instances.
  Cloud only immediate area of the change. If clouding will constrain visibility, readability and clarity of
  information due to many smaller clouds, exception of one larger cloud is permitted.
  If two or more clouds are spaced closely so one Version triangle can touch all of them, usage of one
  Version
  triangle instead of more is permitted.
  Version Triangle needs to match Version in the Versions box in the Title Block as well as Version Tag in
  the
  Title Block.
  Drawings receive a new Version every single time we perform a hand-off.
  2. Versions are noted as Letters and Numbers. Letter Versions represent all Versions before drawings get
  Issued
  for Fabrication and Number Versions represent all Versions Issued to Fabrication.
  3. Version Clouds and Version Triangles reside in Paper Space.
  4. Version Triangle shall reside in upper right corner of the cloud unless not permitted by drawings
  objects.
  5. Version Triangle shall not interfere with the drawing, dimensions and/or anno objects (section cuts, CL
  callouts), it should be in the clear part of the drawing for easier Version recognition.
  6. All changes made to Title Block and Version Block are not to be clouded, regardless of the change type.
  7. Naming of PDF in Drawing File Directory will always be consistent. Example of Correct naming convention
  would
  be: JOB NUMBER JOB NAME VERSION – DRAWING NAME DATE
  For example:
  1764 5th & Columbia Rev 0 – Issued for Fabrication 20180724
  8. Clouds are allowed to be broken if they interfere with Title Block or Drawing Objects.
  9. Approved PDF naming and Version naming needs to stay consistent for easier recognition.
  Examples of approved naming are:
  Issued for First (Second, Third etc) Review (Is sent to Engineer, Project Manager for review)
  Issued for Preliminary Field Measurements (Is sent to field for field measures)
  Issued for Fabrication (Is Issued for Fabrication)
  10. Versions that came after Version 0 will receive “-Revision” at end.
  For example, of PDF naming:
  1764 5th & Columbia Rev 1 Issued for Fabrication – Revision 20181212
  This rule only applies for Numbered Versions, lettered Versions in between numbered Versions will
  not receive “-Revision” at end. They will however carry Numbered and Lettered Version. For example:
  1764 5th & Columbia Rev 0A – Issued for First Review 20180913
  1764 5th & Columbia Rev 0B – Issued for Second Review 20181023
  11. Clouding of Lettered and Numbered Versions will be as follows. At every single lettered and numbered
  Version,
  it is required to cloud the changes. For example: At Version 0A we’ll cloud changes made to rev 0. At Version
  0B,
  we will freeze 0A clouds and cloud changes made to Version 0A and so on. At time of Version 1, we will
  unfreeze
  all clouds and change all rev triangles to 1. In doing so, we’re controlling changes made from 0 to 1 and will
  be
  able to know at exactly which point change was made.
  12. Title sheet is to be reved up with every single Version. In case of multiple Table of Contents, every
  single
  one is to be included but only reved up if sheets on that particular Table of Contents sheet are reving up.
  Otherwise, Table of Contents sheet is to be included at previous Version if no changes to it.
  13. If new sheet is added at any Version after 0, it will be given a starting Version of “A” and at any next
  submittal it will have Version 0, even if entire project is at Version 4, for example.
  14. Version cloud inside another Version cloud is not permitted.
  15. Overlapping Version Clouds are not permitted.
  16. Command “DCLO” is to be used instead of “REVCLOUD”.
  17. For Table of Contents;
  a. Adding and Removal of the sheets cloud whole line including sheet number, title, version and version issue
  date.
  b. Changes made to sheets will be reflected by clouding Version # & Version Issue Date.
  18. All sheets are to be Revved up during Lettered Versions as well as Letter-Number Combo Versions such as
  0A, 0B
  etc. Only sheets that were affected by a change are to be Revved up during Numbered Versions.
  19. Do not leave empty clouds on the drawing.


  1. All Annotative objects including Dimensions shall reside in Model Space. Paper space is reserved for
  Clouding.
  Drawings are to be purged and zoomed to the extents before closing.
  3. All submittals are to be sent in form of PDF.
  4. A Leader line cannot be broken, it has to be continuous and at an angle. It cannot be straight. Best
  practice is
  45 degrees.
  5. Text Leader need to have left and right attachment of “Middle of Top Line” and be at the same scale as
  dimensions.
  6. Text Leader cannot intersect with dimensions. It needs to be clear where leader is pointing to.
  7. All viewports are to be placed on a “.NoPlotViewportBorder” layer.
  8. Layers are not to be forced (all attributes such as color, line type, line thickness and such) are to be
  controlled from layer manager not individually on the ribbon.
  9. Every single detail view needs to have a reference point. Exception to this rule are initial Plan views.
  10. Sheet Set, Drawings, Revit files as well as any drafting objects need to be placed in common place for
  easier
  access.
  11. Use Multi Leader which will have all info preset instead of Leader which does not.
  12. All text including text inside dimensions needs to be the same size.
  13. After completion of a Version, attach latest Version PDF to Smartsheet.
  14. Layer naming needs to start with prefix “AB”.
  15. Layer naming needs to be consistent with object it is on. Naming needs to be clear and explanatory of the
  object. For example, AB-TopRail, AB-BasePlate, AB-Post.
  16. All Work is to be backed up onto an extra drive for protection of information.
  17. Dimension precision is to be set to minimum of 1/32”. Anything larger than 1/32” is
  unacceptable.
  18. While pointing at an edge regular leader is to be used, while pointing to a general area integral leader
  is to
  be used.
  19. During marking up process one is to use 3 different colors to signify the need for change.
  Green marker/pen is used for all items that need to be removed from the project.
  Red marker/pen is used for all items with a mistake.
  Blue marker/pen is used for suggestions, items that are not wrong but should be addressed.
  20. Drawing should never contain PDF imported objects as well as Revit exported objects. It will cause
  slowdowns and
  errors in drawings.
  21. For Revit based CAD drawings VISRETAIN command should be set up to 1. VISRETAIN variable 1 will allow you
  to  control layers and will retain them as you save. VISRETAIN variable 0 will revert to layer states in xref file.
  22. General Notes are always placed in upper right corner. Keyed Notes are always placed below
  General Notes.
  23. General Notes are lowercase lettered while Keyed Notes are numbered.
  24. General Notes are explanatory of entire sheet that they’re placed on, while Keyed Notes have
  to be called out on area they’re pertaining to.
  25. A self-check is to be performed prior to an any internal and external submittal. Print out a set of
  drawings
  when you’re done with them, mark them up. Pick up the marks, make new PDF and do a double check that all markups
  are
  picked up before printing a set for a Cross Check review.
  26. For Konika Minolta, uncheck double-sided printing. Install a special Konika Minolta driver.
  27. Crossing of Dimensions shall be avoided for clarity of information.
  28. Letter “I” shall not be used as prefix for general notes nor any markings due to confusion
  with Number 1.
  29. In crowded drawings use Section Cut Symbol without handles.
  30. For dimensions use 2 decimal places while for angled dimensions use 3 decimal places.
  31. Use 18x24 Cover Sheet & 18x24 Land Sheet Layouts for Drafting. 11x17 may be used for Single Files, while
  8.5x11 may be used for single details.
  32. Every PDF sent out of Drafting Department shall have Proper Name and Date as per Version
  Standard 7 & 9.
  33. DWG file naming needs to be consistent and easy to recognize.
  Example of correct file naming: 1814 Block 21 Stair 11 – Submittal
  Example of incorrect file naming: Block 21 Drawing
  34. DWG naming needs to contain either Submittal or Asbuilts in its name.
  For Example: 1814 Block 21 Stair 11 – Submittal / 1814
  Block 21 Stair 11 – Asbuilts
  35. Project Change Tracker Excel Spreadsheet is to be filled out prior to initial design and prior to any
  change to
  a drawing.
  36.
  4” Diameter Circle to be shown on all guardrail drawings as representation of code understanding.
  6” Diameter Circle to be shown on all stairs.
  For cantilevered stairs be sure to check 6” dia code is met at each angle.
  
  1. Revit Section views are to be exported to AutoCAD in 2D or 3D style. Revit files are not to be imported
  into
  CAD.
  2. Large CAD files exported from Revit are not to be imported to CAD. Creation of “2D Flatshot” is needed in
  this
  case.
  3. Revit exported files are to be loaded into separate drawing due to need of usage of CTB instead of STB.
  This is
  due Revit capabilities of only controlling layers thru color.
  4. Revit exported files are to be kept separate from regular CAD files for clarity of information.
  5. Unit precision needs to be set to minimum of 1/32”. Anything larger is unacceptable.
